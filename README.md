# MedicineReminder
We present an automated system that reminds the user to take the medicines on time.
We aim at making a machine in which, dozes of an entire week can be stored on a single day, and they will drop out for the 
patient to take according to the prescription by the doctor. 
The patient is notified by a speaker on the machine and notification on their smartphone. 
The time at which medicine is taken is recorded and is available for reference by the doctor and the patient.
